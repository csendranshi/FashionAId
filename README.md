Finding the perfect outfit for any occasion can often be a time-consuming challenge, as we all strive to match pieces that complement each other beautifully. This task becomes even more daunting when faced with the common dilemma of feeling like we have nothing to wear, despite a closet full of clothes. The situation deepens complexity for the visually impaired like color blind and aphantasia.

To address these issues, the concept of a streamlined wardrobe emerges, aimed at making the selection process effortless and ensuring that each ensemble is not only stylish but also supremely comfortable. This idea brings a refreshing solution to the age-old problem, making it easier to choose outfits confidently and comfortably, transforming the daily challenge into a delightful experience.

## What it does

This innovative solution revolutionizes the way we approach our wardrobes by providing personalized outfit recommendations based on the contents of your closet. By simply inputting details such as the occasion, desired aesthetic, and preferred colors, the system intelligently suggests the perfect ensemble. It goes a step further by integrating real-time weather data, ensuring that your outfit is not only stylish but also suitable for the day’s conditions. Whether preparing for a sunny day out or a chilly evening event, this tool ensures that you always step out in comfort and style, making outfit selection a breeze.

## How we built it

Our fashion recommendation system utilizes the Gemini API to transform users' wardrobes into a smart, interactive platform. The process starts when users upload their clothing images. Each item is analyzed to identify key features such as color, pattern, and cut, which are then cataloged in a virtual wardrobe database. This digital inventory becomes the foundation for personalized fashion guidance.

Upon receiving a user’s input regarding the occasion and personal style preferences, alongside real-time weather conditions via a Weather API, the system’s prompt generator crafts a precise query. The Gemini API interprets this query, selecting suitable options from the user's own collection, ensuring that the recommended outfits are not just weather-appropriate but also aligned with the user’s unique fashion sense. The result is an intuitive interface presenting outfits that promise to be as functional as they are fashionable.

## Challenges we ran into

System Integration: Achieving seamless operation across all components required meticulous planning and continuous testing to ensure effective data flow and functionality integration.

Parameter and Prompt Optimization: It was crucial to fine-tune the AI parameters and prompts for generating accurate and relevant fashion recommendations. This involved extensive testing and iterative adjustments.

Avoiding Overfitting and Bias: Given limited data on the user, it is difficult to provide highly accurate suggestions.

Time management: Given the hackathon is on Monday and during final's week, we had a challenging time to work together with our schedules.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
